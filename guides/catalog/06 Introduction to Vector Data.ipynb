    "This quick-start guide provides examples to demonstrate some of the basic features of `Vector`. This guide's prerequisite is a notebook environment that includes the `Descartes Labs` Python client and supports `ipyleaflet`. `Vector` tables consist of features, which themselves consist of a `geometry` and `properties`. Features are encoded as `GeoJSON` and support the following geometry types: `Point, MultiPoint, Line, LineString, MultiLine, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon,` and `GeometryCollection`.\n",
