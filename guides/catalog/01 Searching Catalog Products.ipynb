    "# Searching the Catalog\n",
    "All objects support the same search interface. `Searches` work by creating a query builder (class `Search`), which can be used in a fluent programming style to refine the search prior to execution by applying filtering, sorting, and limiting of result sets. Normally `Search` objects are created using class methods on one of the primary object types, e.g. `Product.search()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The searches are then executed by any of several methods: calling the `count()` method to obtain a count of matching objects, using the `Search` object in an iterating context such as a for loop or a list comprehension to yield each matching object in turn, or calling the `collect()` method which will return a list-like collection object (e.g. `ProductCollection`, `BandCollection`, or `ImageCollection`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Search` object methods never mutate the original object, but instead return modified copies. Thus Search objects can be reused for both further modification and repeated executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at two of the most commonly searched for types of objects: products and images."
