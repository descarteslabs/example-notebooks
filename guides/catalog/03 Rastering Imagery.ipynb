    "`mosaic(`) can be used to composite the images to form a single image, resulting in a 3D array. A mosaic composite uses, for each pixel location, the pixel value from the last image in the collection containing a valid (unmasked) pixel value at that location. Since individual images may not cover the same pixels this operation is typically used to combine overlapping images to obtain a single complete image. If the image collection is sorted by increasing acquisition date, this means the most recent image wins. You can use the `sort()` method on the search object to alter the ordering of the images in the collection, or the `sort()` method on the ImageCollection itself to alter the ordering of the images and hence the results of the mosaic operation."
